Tuesday 3/5/24
 - Wrote FSM Class
    - problem /w updating state register in loop
 - Meeting:
    - sparse mux with concatenated input selection wire
    - Goal: Finish FSM and three examples by next Tuesday
 - Current Example Goals:
    - Vending Machine
    - Accumulator (dependent and independent FSMs)
    - 2 interconnected FSMs

Wednesday 3/6/24]
 - wrote base line FSM Class 
    - rules pre generated and hard coded as dict
    - draw FSM => generate rule set => simulate FSM
 - TO DO: create examples

Thursday 5/2/24
 - Trying to get Moore Machine style output
    - output value vs output circuit
    -
